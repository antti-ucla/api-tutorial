    "## What's an API? \n",
    "\n",
    "Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow one piece of software to interact with another over the Internet. They typically use HTTP/HTTPS to send requests and receive responses, often formatted in JSON or XML. Web APIs let developers integrate different systems and access remote services, such as AI language models, cooking recipes, weather data etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's an HTTP request?\n",
    "\n",
    "An HTTP request is a message sent by a client (like a web browser or an API client) to a server asking for a resource or action. Its format is defined by the HTTP protocol. It typically includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A Request Line: Specifies the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) and the URL.\n",
    "    Headers: Provide additional information (like content type, authorization, etc.).\n",
    "    An Optional Body: Carries data for methods like POST or PUT.\n",
    "\n",
    "This request lets the server know what the client wants, and the server responds with an HTTP response containing the requested data or the result of the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to make an HTTP request in a terminal?\n",
    "\n",
    "Run this command in the same terminal window. Replace $OPENAI_API_KEY with your actual API key. Make sure that you don't commit the API key into any Github repo or otherwise share it online.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\n",
    "    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \n",
    "    -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \n",
    "    -d '{\n",
    "        \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n",
    "        \"store\": true,\n",
    "        \"messages\": [\n",
    "        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n",
    "        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Why is the sky blue?\"}\n",
    "        ]\n",
    "        }'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "1. 'curl' is a HTTP terminal client\n",
    "2. -H \"blah blah blah\" sets an HTTP header.\n",
    "3. \"Content-Type\": We need to tell in which format the content we send is (JSON).\n",
    "4. \"Authorization: Bearer XYZ\" supplies the API secret key\n",
    "6. \"-d\" tells curl to send a POST request with the data specified after the \"-d\". In this case, the data is a JSON string\n",
    "\n",
    "## JSON (JavaScript object notation)\n",
    "   1. a JSON value is one of:\n",
    "       - a string (\"string\")\n",
    "       - a number (4)\n",
    "       - a boolean (true / false)\n",
    "       - null (null)\n",
    "       - an object { ... }\n",
    "       - a list [ ... ]\n",
    "   3. An object has key-value fields separated by commas. A value can be anything specified in 1.\n",
    "      ```json\n",
    "      {\n",
    "      \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n",
    "      \"store\": true\n",
    "      }\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "   3. A list encloses any values specified in 1, separated by a comma. In the example, the \"messages\" field has a list with two objects:\n",
    "      ```json\n",
    "      [\n",
    "        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n",
    "        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Why is the sky blue?\"}\n",
    "      ]\n",
    "      ```"

    "\n",
    "### Installing a virtual environment for Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is a way to isolate installed Python packages so that the dependencies of projects won't conflict with one another. For example, project A uses package X with version 1.2 and project B uses packages X with version 2.0. You can't satisfy both requirements at the same time if you install the packages globally (the \"basic\" way). \n",
    "\n",
    "The following will install `pipenv` package manager and virtual environment. You can also use `conda` which works very similarly.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test that you have Python installed: `python3 --version` or `python --version`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install pipenv virtual environment with pip. pip is the basic package manager. ```pip install --user pipenv```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Change into your project directory: `cd ~/projects/api-tutorial` (depending where you put the directory)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Install packages: `pipenv install openai dotenv`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Run your script `pipenv run python3 my_script.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. You can also enter into the virtual environment with `pipenv shell` and then `python3 my_script.py`. When inside the virtual environment, all the Python scripts will use the packages of that environment."

      "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it is composed of various colors that correspond to different wavelengths of light. Shorter wavelengths, such as blue and violet, are scattered more easily by the gases and particles in the atmosphere than longer wavelengths like red and yellow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although violet light is scattered even more than blue light, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and less sensitive to violet, plus some of the violet light is absorbed by the ozone layer. As a result, we predominantly perceive the sky as blue during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "During sunrise and sunset, the sun is lower on the horizon, and sunlight passes through a thicker layer of the atmosphere. This increased distance causes more scattering of the shorter blue and violet wavelengths, allowing the longer wavelengths (red, orange, and yellow) to dominate the sky's appearance, which is why we often see beautiful reds and oranges during those times.\n"
