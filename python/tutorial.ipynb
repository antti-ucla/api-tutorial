    "## What's an API? \n",
    "\n",
    "Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow one piece of software to interact with another over the Internet. They typically use HTTP/HTTPS to send requests and receive responses, often formatted in JSON or XML. Web APIs let developers integrate different systems and access remote services, such as AI language models, cooking recipes, weather data etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's an HTTP request?\n",
    "\n",
    "An HTTP request is a message sent by a client (like a web browser or an API client) to a server asking for a resource or action. Its format is defined by the HTTP protocol. It typically includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A Request Line: Specifies the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) and the URL.\n",
    "    Headers: Provide additional information (like content type, authorization, etc.).\n",
    "    An Optional Body: Carries data for methods like POST or PUT.\n",
    "\n",
    "This request lets the server know what the client wants, and the server responds with an HTTP response containing the requested data or the result of the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to make an HTTP request in a terminal?\n",
    "\n",
    "Run this command in the same terminal window. Replace $OPENAI_API_KEY with your actual API key. Make sure that you don't commit the API key into any Github repo or otherwise share it online.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\n",
    "    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \n",
    "    -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \n",
    "    -d '{\n",
    "        \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n",
    "        \"store\": true,\n",
    "        \"messages\": [\n",
    "        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n",
    "        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Why is the sky blue?\"}\n",
    "        ]\n",
    "        }'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "1. 'curl' is a HTTP terminal client\n",
    "2. -H \"blah blah blah\" sets an HTTP header.\n",
    "3. \"Content-Type\": We need to tell in which format the content we send is (JSON).\n",
    "4. \"Authorization: Bearer XYZ\" supplies the API secret key\n",
    "6. \"-d\" tells curl to send a POST request with the data specified after the \"-d\". In this case, the data is a JSON string\n",
    "\n",
    "## JSON (JavaScript object notation)\n",
    "   1. a JSON value is one of:\n",
    "       - a string (\"string\")\n",
    "       - a number (4)\n",
    "       - a boolean (true / false)\n",
    "       - null (null)\n",
    "       - an object { ... }\n",
    "       - a list [ ... ]\n",
    "   3. An object has key-value fields separated by commas. A value can be anything specified in 1.\n",
    "      ```json\n",
    "      {\n",
    "      \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n",
    "      \"store\": true\n",
    "      }\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "   3. A list encloses any values specified in 1, separated by a comma. In the example, the \"messages\" field has a list with two objects:\n",
    "      ```json\n",
    "      [\n",
    "        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n",
    "        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Why is the sky blue?\"}\n",
    "      ]\n",

    "## Store the API key in a .env file\n",
    "\n",
    "The .env file is a file that contains environment variables. In this case, we store the API key in the .env file. The .env file is not included in the git repository, so it is safe to store sensitive information in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an empty file named \".env\" inside \"api-tutorial/python\" directory and add the following line to it:\n",
    "```export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your_api_key_here\"```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how you can use the API key in the .env file in a shell command:\n",
    "```source .env && echo $OPENAI_API_KEY```\n",
    "\n",
    "It should print the API key. If it doesn't, you might need to restart your terminal or IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook cell below uses the API key from the .env file to make a request to the API. (Note that a \"!\" at the beginning of a line in a Jupyter notebook cell means that the line is executed as a shell command.)"

This increased distance causes more scattering of shorter-wavelength light (blue and green) out of the line of sight, leaving the longer wavelengths (red, orange, and yellow) to dominate the sky's color.\\n\\nIn addition, the presence of particles or pollutants in the atmosphere, such as dust or smoke, can enhance the scattering of shorter wavelengths and make the reds and oranges even more pronounced.

    "A virtual environment is a way to isolate installed Python packages so that the dependencies of projects won't conflict with one another. For example, project A uses package X with version 1.2 and project B uses packages X with version 2.0. You can't satisfy both requirements at the same time if you install the packages globally (the \"basic\" way). \n",
    "\n",
    "The following will install `pipenv` package manager and virtual environment. You can also use `conda` which works very similarly.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Change into your project directory: `cd ~/api-tutorial/python` (depending where you put the directory)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Install packages: `pipenv install`. This will create a virtual environment and install the packages listed in `Pipfile`. (A Pipfile details which packages are required in the project. You can also install packages with `pipenv install openai` directly if you don't have a `Pipfile`.) \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Run your script `pipenv run python3 tutorial.py`\n",
